# Rotation 3D

## Introduction
This MonoGame project will allow the rotation of my object (airplane) using Roll, Pitch, and Yaw values in one smooth rotation. The rotation can be done with either converting the angles to a Matrix, or using a Quaternion, then to the matrix.

## Game Assets
The game assets for this project are:

* CourierNew.spritefont
* piper_bump.jpg
* piper_diffuse.jpg
* piper_pa18.fbx
* piper_refl.jpg

## Glitches
Not so much a glitch, but of something to work on. I would like to be able to rotate the plane, using the same or different angles, after the initial rotation has been completed.
