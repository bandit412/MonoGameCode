# Collision Demo

# Introduction
This MonoGame project demonstrates the collision of multiple objects in 2D space

# Game Assets
You will need a ball and a boundary (thin vertical rectangle) for this project to work

# Glitches
Every once in a while, when two balls collide, they stick together, or behave unexpectedly
