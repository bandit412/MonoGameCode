# Transform 3D

## Introduction
This MonoGame project demonstrates linear transformation, shifting and scaling, of an object in 3D space.

## Game Assests
The game assets for this project are:

* CourierNew.spritefont

## Glitches
* Scaling appears to be disproportionate. This is due to the coordinate system usedn in MonoGame. I have tried to make some adjustments for this, yet there is still an issue with scaling; shifting appears to be working correctly.
* Need a 3D spehere to act as a point (silimar to the point in Transform 2D).
