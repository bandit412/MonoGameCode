# MonoGameCode

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to share code that I have been working on; the code is for demonstration of math and physics concepts for a course that I teach. Most of the source code does work, yet there are a few _glitches_ that I still need to work on.

## Game Assets
Some of the game assets are not part of this repository.
