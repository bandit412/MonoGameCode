# MonoGame Code

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to share code that I have been working on; the code is for demonstration of math and physics concepts for a course that I teach. Most of the source code does work, yet there are a few _glitches_ that I still need to work on.

## Game Assets
The game assets are included with each project.

## Game Projects
So far I have completed the following projects:

* 2D Rotation
* Projectile Motion
* Spinning Projectile
* 3D Rotation - two versions
* Forces at Angles
* 2D Collisions
* 2D & 3D Transforms
* Springs (adapted from other authors)
