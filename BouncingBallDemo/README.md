# Ball Ball Demo

## Introduction
This is the source code only for a MonoGame project. The project is about a ball bouncing inside 2D space showing height degrading over time. I increased the gravity from -9.81 to -981 for a quicker height degradation over time.

## Game Assets
The game assets for this project are:

* boundary.png
* CourierNew.spritefont
* largeFont.spritefont
* RedBall.png


## Glitches
As the height nears 0 (bottom of the game window), the ball vibrates and often begins to exit the game window.
