# Transform 2D

## Introduction
This MonoGame project demonstrates linear transformation, shifting and scaling, of an object in 2D space.

## Game Assests
There are no game assets provided with this project

## Glitches
Scaling appears to be disproportionate. This is due to the coordinate system usedn in MonoGame. I have tried to make some adjustments for this, yet there is still an issue with scaling; shifting appears to be working correctly.
